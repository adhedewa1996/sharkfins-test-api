Thisindicator rises as a response to market demand growth. If demand weakens,capacity utilization will diminish. Capacity utilization is a useful indicatorof inflation pressures. It is believed that capacity utilization above 82-85%propels price inflation.The Federal Reserve Board constructs estimates of capacity and capacityutilization for industries in manufacturing, mining, and electric and gasutilities. For a given industry, the capacity utilization rate is equal to anoutput index (seasonally adjusted) divided by a capacity index. The FederalReserve Board's capacity indexes attempt to capture the concept of sustainablemaximum output  (the greatest level of output a plant can maintain within theframework of a realistic work schedule) after factoring in normal downtime andassuming sufficient availability of inputs to operate the capital in place. Themonthly rates of capacity utilization are designed to be consistent with boththe monthly data on production and the periodically available data on capacityand utilization.",

Too much inventories can causeeconomic downturn. However, a certain level is necessary to be able to continueproduction and sell goods.Inventories are on a non-LIFO basis as of the end ofthe month. The Manufacturing and Trade Inventory and Sales estimates are basedon data from three surveys: the Monthly Retail Trade Survey, the MonthlyWholesale Trade Survey, and the Manufacturersâ€™ Shipments, Inventories, andOrders Survey. The sampling variability for retailers and merchant wholesalerscan be used to construct a 90 percent confidence interval for the estimates.Over all possible samples, 90 percent of such intervals will cover the trueestimate. These intervals are given in parentheses for the estimates on thefront page.",
